# Experiment 4: Aggregate Functions, Group By and Having Clause
### Name : Kabira A
### Reg No : 212224040146
## AIM
To study and implement aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING clause with suitable examples.

## THEORY

### Aggregate Functions
These perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

- **MIN()** – Smallest value  
- **MAX()** – Largest value  
- **COUNT()** – Number of rows  
- **SUM()** – Total of values  
- **AVG()** – Average of values

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### GROUP BY
Groups records with the same values in specified columns.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```
### HAVING
Filters the grouped records based on aggregate conditions.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;
```

**Question 1**
---
What is the average dosage prescribed for each medication?
```
select Medication,avg(Dosage) as AvgDosage
from Prescriptions
group by Medication;

```

**Question 8**
---
Write the SQL query that achieves the grouping of data by occupation, calculates the average work hours for each occupation, and includes only those occupations where the average work hour falls between 10 and 12.

```
select occupation,AVG(workhour)
from employee1
group by occupation
having avg(workhour) between 10 and 12;

```

**Output:**

<img width="517" height="319" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-20 222554" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf2f2caf-0f31-43f4-a892-60bce94eda83" />



**Question 9**
---
Write the SQL query that accomplishes the grouping of data by addresses, calculates the sum of salaries for each address, and excludes addresses where the total salary sum is not greater than 2000.



```
select address,sum(salary) as 'SUM(salary)'
from customer1
group by address
having sum(salary) > 2000;

```

**Output:**

<img width="497" height="379" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-20 222545" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f1d032e-17da-4622-93a0-52aa2a21c82b" />



**Question 10**
---
Write the SQL query that achieves the grouping of data by occupation, calculates the total work hours for each occupation, and excludes occupations where the total work hour sum is not greater than 20.
