# Experiment 6: Joins
### NAME : KABIRA A
### REG NO : 212224040146
## AIM
To study and implement different types of joins.

## THEORY

SQL Joins are used to combine records from two or more tables based on a related column.

### 1. INNER JOIN
Returns records with matching values in both tables.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### 2. LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 3. RIGHT JOIN
Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write the SQL query that accomplishes the selection of the first name and last name from the "patients" table, with an inner join on the "patient_id" column and a condition filtering for surgeries with a surgery date between '2024-01-01' and '2024-01-31'.

```
SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name
FROM patients p
INNER JOIN surgeries s
ON p.patient_id = s.patient_id
WHERE s.surgery_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31';

```

**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
From the following tables write a SQL query to find those orders where the order amount exists between 500 and 2000. Return ord_no, purch_amt, cust_name, city.


```

SELECT 
    o.ord_no,
    o.purch_amt,
    c.cust_name,
    c.city
FROM 
    orders o
JOIN 
    customer c
ON 
    o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE 
    o.purch_amt BETWEEN 500 AND 2000;

```

**Question 3**
---
Write the SQL query that achieves the selection of the "cust_name" column from the "customer" table (aliased as "c"), with a left join on the "customer_id" column and a condition filtering for orders with a purchase amount less than 100.

'customer' Table: (customer_id, cust_name, city, grade, salesman_id)

'orders' Table: (ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id)

```

SELECT c.cust_name
FROM customer c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.purch_amt < 100;

```

**Output:**

**Question 4**
---
Write the SQL query that achieves the selection of the first name from the "patients" table (aliased as "patient_name") and all columns from the "test_results" table (aliased as "t"), with an inner join on the "patient_id" column.

PATIENTS TABLE:

ATTRIBUTES - patient_id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, admission_date, discharge_date, doctor_id

```
SELECT p.first_name AS patient_name, 
       t.result_id, 
       t.patient_id, 
       t.test_name, 
       t.result, 
       t.test_date
FROM patients p
INNER JOIN test_results t
ON p.patient_id = t.patient_id;

```

**Output:**

**Question 5**
---
Write the SQL query that achieves the selection of the "cust_name" column from the "customer" table (aliased as "c") and the "name" column from the "salesman" table (aliased as "s"), with a left join on the "salesman_id" column and a condition filtering for customers in the same city as the salesman.

Customer Table: (customer_id, cust_name, city, grade, salesman_id)

Salesman Table: (salesman_id, name, city, commission)

```
SELECT c.cust_name, 
       s.name
FROM customer c
LEFT JOIN salesman s
ON c.salesman_id = s.salesman_id
WHERE c.city = s.city;

```

**Output:**

**Question 6**
---
Write the SQL query that achieves the selection of the first name from the "patients" table (aliased as "patient_name") and all columns from the "appointments" table (aliased as "a"), with an inner join on the "patient_id" column.

PATIENTS TABLE:

ATTRIBUTES - patient_id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, admission_date, discharge_date, doctor_id

```
SELECT p.first_name AS patient_name,
       a.appointment_id,
       a.patient_id,
